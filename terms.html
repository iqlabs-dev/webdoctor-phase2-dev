        <h3>6. Intellectual property</h3>

          You may not resell, sublicense, or commercially exploit the services without our written permission.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Your content</h3>
        <p>
          When you submit URLs, property information, or other content to our services, you retain ownership of that
          content. You grant iQLABS a licence to process, store, and use the content solely as necessary to provide the

        <h3>9. Third-party services</h3>
        <p>
          Our products may integrate with or depend on third-party services such as Paddle, analytics providers, or AI
          platforms (for example, OpenAI). Your use of those third-party services may be subject to their own terms and
          privacy policies. iQLABS is not responsible for third-party services that we do not control.
        </p>

        <h3>10. Availability and changes to the services</h3>
        <p>
          We aim to keep our services available and reliable, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted operation.
          We may modify, suspend, or discontinue all or part of the services at any time, for example to perform
          maintenance, address security issues, or improve functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where a change materially affects your paid use of the services, we will try to provide reasonable notice,
          consistent with applicable law and our Billing & Refund Policy.
        </p>

        <h3>11. Disclaimers</h3>
        <p>
          Our services, including all scores, diagnostics, and reports, are provided “as is” and “as available” without
          warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to warranties of
          merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Diagnostic results and scores are intended as decision-support tools only. They do not constitute legal,
          financial, or professional advice, and should not be treated as guarantees of performance, security, or
          compliance.
        </p>

        <h3>12. Limitation of liability</h3>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, iQLABS will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential,
          special, or exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with your use of the services, including but not
          limited to loss of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where liability cannot be excluded, our total aggregate liability arising out of or relating to your use of the
          services will not exceed the amount you have paid to iQLABS for the services during the three (3) months
          immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
        </p>

        <h3>13. Indemnity</h3>
        <p>
          To the extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless iQLABS, our directors, officers,
          employees, and contractors from and against any claims, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable
          legal fees) arising from your use of the services, violation of these Terms, or infringement of any third-party
          rights.
        </p>

        <h3>14. Termination</h3>
        <p>
          You may stop using our services at any time and may deactivate your account where such a feature is available,
          or by contacting us.
        </p>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the services (including paid accounts) if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You materially breach these Terms;</li>
          <li>Your use creates a security risk or other significant risk for us or other users; or</li>
          <li>We are required to do so by law or by a governmental or regulatory body.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Termination will not affect any rights or obligations that have already accrued. Details on how billing is
          handled on termination are set out in our Billing & Refund Policy.
        </p>

        <h3>15. Governing law and jurisdiction</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of New Zealand, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. Subject to any
          mandatory local rights you may have, any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the
          services will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand courts.
        </p>

        <h3>16. Changes to these Terms</h3>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of
          this page and, where appropriate, provide additional notice (for example, via email or an in-product notice).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you continue using the services after the updated Terms take effect, you will be deemed to have accepted
          the changes.
        </p>

        These Terms exist to keep things fair, clear, and predictable for everyone using iQLABS products.
        When you work with us, you should always know what you can expect from the platform — and what we
        expect from you in return. Simple rules, written in plain language, so we can focus on building
        tools that actually help you do better work.
